This report is an investigation into the Playground Series Credit Card Fraud Detection on Kaggle. The dataset was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Credit Card Fraud Detection. Our goal is to construct several simple machine learning models which can predict the Class attribute using the other attributes included in the dataset. This variable is binary, therefore, making this a binary classification problem. First we investigated the properties of the dataset. Next, we selected a method for imputing missing data values and prepared the dataset for use in modelling. Following this, a number of models were assessed, these were: Stochastic Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Histogram-Gradient Boosting classifiers. We assessed each model with a performance measure and analysed the confusion matrices to assess the accuracy, precision, and recall of each model.
